Hello, World! :D

Welcome to paralolz.net!

This website was made with the intents and purposes
of creating a user-based multimedia platform for people
ranging from at or around 13 years or older to 18+.

(18+ Section coming soon when I turn 18)

lol anyways...

Forgive me if this website seems more like a joke.
This was originally made with vaporwave ideas in
mind, as well, so...yeah.

This is my first time making a website, okay?

Just saying. UwU
